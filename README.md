## Critical Business Findings

### 1. Route Efficiency Performance

![Top Performing Routes](charts/01_route_efficiency_ranking.png)

**What the Data Shows:**
The top 15 fastest routes achieve speeds between 36.7-41.4 km/h, with Bus 519 leading at 41.4 km/h.

**Why This Matters:**
- These routes represent operational excellence and serve as benchmarks
- Fast routes indicate optimal traffic conditions, route design, or express service models
- Speed directly impacts customer satisfaction and operational costs

**Business Action:**
Study the characteristics of top performers (routing, scheduling, stop spacing) to replicate success across underperforming routes.

### 2. Resource-Intensive Routes

![Longest Journey Times](charts/02_longest_journeys.png)

**What the Data Shows:**
The 15 routes with longest journey times range from 115-218 minutes, with some covering distances up to 131 km.

**Why This Matters:**
- Longer journeys tie up vehicles and drivers for extended periods
- These routes require more operational resources (fuel, maintenance, labor)
- Extended journey times increase risk of delays and service disruptions
- High resource intensity directly impacts profitability per route

**Business Action:**
**Priority:** Evaluate whether ultra-long routes (131+ km, 3+ hours) should be split into segments with transfer points. This improves vehicle utilization and service frequency.

---

### 3. Carrier Market Dynamics

![Top 10 Carriers](charts/03_top_carriers.png)

**What the Data Shows:**
BakuBus MMC dominates with 55 routes covering 2,466 km, significantly ahead of second-place carriers operating 18-19 routes each.

**Why This Matters:**
- Extreme market concentration (one carrier operates 26% of all routes)
- Top 3 carriers control nearly 45% of the network
- Smaller carriers may offer flexibility but lack economies of scale
- Service quality and standardization depends heavily on one dominant operator

**Business Action:**
- **Risk Mitigation:** Reduce dependency on single carrier through strategic diversification
- **Quality Standards:** Implement consistent KPIs across all operators
- **Performance Incentives:** Link carrier compensation to speed and reliability metrics

---

### 4. Network Design Strategy

![04_route_length_distribution.png](charts/04_route_length_distribution.png)

**What the Data Shows:**
Most routes fall into Medium (10-20 km) and Long (20-30 km) categories, with significant presence in Very Long (30-40 km) and Ultra Long (40+ km) segments.

**Why This Matters:**
- Current network prioritizes suburban and inter-district connectivity
- Long routes require more resources and have higher operational complexity
- Service frequency may suffer on ultra-long routes

**Business Action:**
**Network Optimization:** Consider splitting ultra-long routes into segments with transfer points at major hubs. This improves frequency and reliability while reducing single-vehicle journey times.

---

### 5. Service Accessibility Analysis

![05_stop_density_analysis.png](charts/05_stop_density_analysis.png)

**What the Data Shows:**
Stop density varies significantly across routes, with median density around 2 stops/km. Longer routes generally have lower stop density, shown by color-coded speed performance.

**Why This Matters:**
- Higher stop density increases accessibility but reduces speed
- The trade-off between coverage and efficiency must be optimized
- Green (faster) routes show optimal balance between stops and speed

**Business Action:**
Identify routes with excessive stop density (>3 stops/km) on longer routes. These are candidates for express service variants that skip minor stops.

---

### 6. Time-Distance Efficiency

![06_duration_vs_distance.png](charts/06_duration_vs_distance.png)

**What the Data Shows:**
A linear relationship exists between route length and travel time (trend: 1.7 min/km). Routes colored by number of stops reveal that more stops extend journey times beyond the trend line.

**Why This Matters:**
- Predictable travel times are essential for service planning and passenger expectations
- Routes significantly above the trend line have inefficiency issues
- Stop count is a primary driver of journey duration

**Business Action:**
**Benchmark:** Use the 1.7 min/km benchmark to identify problematic routes. Routes exceeding 2.0 min/km should be reviewed for traffic issues, excessive stops, or poor routing.

---

### 7. Network Connectivity

![07_transport_hub_coverage.png](charts/07_transport_hub_coverage.png)

**What the Data Shows:**
Top routes connect 10-15 transport hubs while serving 60-90 total stops.

**Why This Matters:**
- Transport hubs are critical transfer points in the network
- Routes connecting multiple hubs enable seamless passenger transfers
- Hub integration reduces the need for private vehicle ownership

**Business Action:**
**Expansion Strategy:** Prioritize routes that connect underserved hubs. Ensure all major hubs have at least 3-5 direct route connections. This enhances network effect and ridership.

---

### 8. Revenue Collection Infrastructure

![08_payment_methods.png](charts/08_payment_methods.png)

**What the Data Shows:**
The majority of routes support card payment ("Kart"), with some routes offering cash or mixed payment options.

**Why This Matters:**
- Card payment reduces cash handling costs and fraud
- Digital payment enables data collection for usage analytics
- Mixed payment systems increase operational complexity

**Business Action:**
**Digital Transition:** Accelerate the migration to 100% card-based payment. Provide incentives for carriers to upgrade infrastructure. Target full digitalization within 12 months for improved revenue tracking and reduced operating costs.

---

### 9. Pricing Strategy

![09_tariff_analysis.png](charts/09_tariff_analysis.png)

**What the Data Shows:**
Most routes charge 0.60 AZN, with some variation to 0.40 AZN for certain service categories.

**Why This Matters:**
- Standardized pricing simplifies passenger experience
- Fare differentiation can incentivize off-peak usage or reward loyal customers
- Pricing is a key lever for demand management and revenue optimization

**Business Action:**
**Dynamic Pricing Pilot:** Test distance-based or express route surcharges on high-demand corridors. Evaluate passenger response and revenue impact before network-wide rollout.

---

### 10. Regional Service Distribution

![10_regional_coverage.png](charts/10_regional_coverage.png)

**What the Data Shows:**
Service heavily concentrated in Bakı region, with minimal presence in other regions.

**Why This Matters:**
- Geographic concentration indicates market maturity in Bakı
- Expansion opportunities exist in underserved regions
- Regional imbalance may affect equity and accessibility goals

**Business Action:**
**Growth Strategy:** Evaluate demand in secondary regions. Pilot routes in high-potential areas to test market viability. Bakı remains the core, but diversification reduces dependency risk.

---

### 11. Service Type Classification

![11_avg_stop_distance.png](charts/11_avg_stop_distance.png)

**What the Data Shows:**
Routes naturally segment into express/rapid services (large stop spacing, 2+ km between stops) and local services (dense spacing, <1 km between stops).

**Why This Matters:**
- Different customer segments have different needs: speed vs. accessibility
- Express routes attract commuters; local routes serve neighborhoods
- Service classification enables targeted marketing and resource allocation

**Business Action:**
**Service Branding:** Formally classify routes as "Express," "Rapid," or "Local." Communicate service levels clearly to passengers. Adjust fares and frequencies accordingly.

---

### 12. Performance Portfolio

![12_efficiency_matrix.png](charts/12_efficiency_matrix.png)

**What the Data Shows:**
Routes fall into four quadrants:
- **Green (Top-Right):** High coverage + High efficiency - Portfolio stars
- **Blue (Top-Left):** Express routes with high efficiency but fewer stops
- **Orange (Bottom-Right):** High coverage but slow - Optimization candidates
- **Red (Bottom-Left):** Low coverage and slow - Strategic review required

**Why This Matters:**
- Portfolio approach enables data-driven resource allocation
- Each quadrant requires different management strategies
- Red quadrant routes may not be financially viable

**Business Action:**
**Portfolio Management:**
- **Green routes:** Maintain and replicate
- **Blue routes:** Market as premium express services
- **Orange routes:** Improve speed through stop reduction or route adjustments
- **Red routes:** Evaluate discontinuation or major restructuring
